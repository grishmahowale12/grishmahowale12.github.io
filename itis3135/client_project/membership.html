                <p>Current students or alumni may apply to become members of SASA. Voting membership is limited to the Executive Board, who are currently enrolled as students. Others, such as faculty, alumni, and professionals, are encouraged to become members as non-voting, associate, or honorary members. Members are required to pay dues to be considered official members of SASA. Payment of dues grants access to exclusive benefits such as stickers, T-shirts, and discounts at SASA events. An Executive Board Member may be removed from SASA for failure to abide by the rules stated in the organization's constitution.</p>
